In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
Open the starter code notebook and use it to complete the following steps:

Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.

Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.
